LCA Standard Graphs
===================

This simple module compiles plotting functions that are used over and over again in life-cycle assessment, and more generally in Industrial Ecology and Sustainability research. It aims to stay simple, modular, and generally applicable in various projects.

It notably includes generic functions to:

- produce normalized **grouped stacked bar graphs** for comparisons of various technologies in terms of different impacts, broken down into contributing life-cycle stages

- produce a **stochastic analysis graphs**, showing the probability that technology 1 have a lower impact than technology 2 in terms of various environmental impacts
