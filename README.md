LCA Standard Graphs
===================

This simple module compiles plotting functions that are used over and over again in life-cycle assessment, and more generally in Industrial Ecology and Sustainability research. It aims to stay simple, modular, and generally applicable in various projects.

It notably includes generic functions to:

- produce normalized grouped stacked bar graphs for comparisons of various technologies in terms of different impacts, broken down into contributing life-cycle stages

- produce a stochastic analysis graphs, showing the probability that technology A have a lower impact than technology B in terms of various environmental impacts

Contributions most welcome...
